        <h2>What is Artificial Intelligence?</h2>
        <p>
          Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human
          intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and act like
          humans. It involves the development of algorithms and computer
          programs that can perform tasks that typically require human
          intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition,
          decision-making, and language translation.

        <h2>Types of Artificial Intelligence</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Reactive machines:</strong> These AI systems do not have
            memory and cannot use past experiences to inform future decisions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Limited memory:</strong> These AI systems can use past
            experiences to make informed decisions, but their memory is limited.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Theory of mind:</strong> These AI systems can understand
            human emotions and thoughts.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Self-aware:</strong> These AI systems have a sense of self
            and can make decisions based on that self-awareness.
          </li>

        <h2>Applications of Artificial Intelligence</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Speech recognition:</strong> AI is used in speech
            recognition systems such as Siri and Alexa.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Image recognition:</strong> AI is used in image recognition
            systems such as Google Photos.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Natural language processing:</strong> AI is used in natural
            language processing systems such as chatbots.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Autonomous vehicles:</strong> AI is used in autonomous
            vehicles such as self-driving cars.
          </li>
